Home of the Objects-Are-King language!

Its a weird language where everything is an object, even classes and functions.

To make a new class, you make a new objet and add the fields you want.  
Then when you want to make an instance of a class you .clone() the class object you made!  

You can try to get/set any field of any object with dot (.)  
a.x = 3;  
print(a.x);  
print(a.y); //error, y field does not exist  

Functions:
b.x = {
ret b.y+b.c+1;
}

print(b.clone().y,c=3,5);
//prints 3+5+1 = 9
